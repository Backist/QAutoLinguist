# =============================   QAutoLinguist Configuration File    =====================================
# This file is auto-generated by qautolinguist.Config .
# If you are not very familiar with the configuration file format, 
# just fill in the fields in the "Required" section. 
# Be cautious when placing values.
# Take these measures:
# 1. Do not use "" or '' to specify text strings, even if you want to specify paths containing spaces;
#      the parser parses them internally; it will cause an error if you do.
# 2. This format uses empty lines to detect braces and attributes. 
#      If you have to specify multi-line values, increase the indentation for each new line.
# ===============================================================================

[Required]
# .ui or .py file to search for "tr" funcs.

# Reference locale, took as a reference to make other translations.

# nish, etc).
