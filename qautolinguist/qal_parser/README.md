THThis folder contains an unfinished parser for .tsf files, a file type with syntax familiar to .ini files
in order to provide an easy and familiar format to the user to put the parameters, but was discarded and succedded to .ini files due to 
their wide backwards compatibility and popularity. That is why it is no longer used, but it is preserved.
